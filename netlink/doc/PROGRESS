#This file is to list progress of the DBUS project:

# 1. I put some slides on the G-BUS. This will need to be updated after the project is complete to capture the experiences in the project
# 2. I started to look into the GLIB API for the GBus, note that there are two APIs. One is the high level and the other is the low level
     Actully the work is in the libgio and not in libglib
# 3. Started to work on the High level api, described in https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/
# 4. I faced some issues at the begining with the error about not calling the g_type_init() and I discovered that the current api only works for glib-2.0 versions above 2.36
     Since I am working with Ubuntu 12.04LTS, which only supports up to version 2.32, I had some issues
     I tried to resolve these issues by downloading and building glib-2.0 version 2.40 but since it is not supported by ubuntu, I was afraid in running into issues 
     So I decided to move to Ubuntu 14.04LTS which supports the glib-2.0 version 2.40
     $ sudo apt-get install glib-2.0
     Later, I should make adjustments to my program to handle versions before that
     One concern I have is that raspbian (for the raspberry Pi only supports up to 2.32 as well) so either, I will need to upgrade it, or make my program support the old versions
     This is a future task TODO
# 5. Note that there is a lot of good examples in the glib folder to how to use the library
     To learn about owning names or watching name check the file :
     To learn about building a Object manager server check the file: gdbus_example_objectmanager-servr.c
# 6. Keep in mind that if you try to run the program from an ssh session, it will not succeed. It has to use ssh -X for the application to be able to connect to the dbus
