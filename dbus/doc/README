#This is a readme file for the D-BUS project

#Target for this project is to do the following:
## 1. Learn about the D-Bus and its terminology
## 2. Learn about the different wrappers GLib, QT, Python
## 3. Use this knowledge to interface to hostapd, and wpa_supplicant 

#Steps taken:
## 1. Read a few documents about the D-Bus, and prepare a Lecture slides on the topic
## 2. Build a Client/server application that communicate via the D-Bus
### 2.a. Using GLib High Level API
### 2.b. Using GLib Low Level API
### 2.c. Using QT API
### 2.d. Using Python Bindings
## 3. Build a user plane application to interface to wpa_suplicant (TODO Put details on what it should be doing)
## 4. Build a user plane application to interface to hostapd (TODO... Put details on what it should be doing)
