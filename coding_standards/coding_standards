Coding Standards
================

This document describes the coding standards that I should be following

1. file names should be all small letters, and use separation with underscore
   examples:  my_file.h   this_is_another_file.c

2. function names should be small letters and preceeeded by the the object name followed by an underscore
   examples: myObjectName_functionName    

3. In function definitions, and fuction declarations, we should have a space between the function name and the ()
   examples: myObjectName_function ()

4. In funtion usage, don't use space between funtion name and ()
   examples: myObjectName_funtion();

5. In header files, in function prototypes, don't use variable names, just put types
